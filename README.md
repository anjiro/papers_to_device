#README

This project contains a small Python script that copies papers from [Papers 3.0](http://papersapp.com) and up to and from an external drive.

##Why you might need it
Why would you want to do this, when Papers already has Dropbox sync support? I use it with my giant [Sony DPT-S1](https://pro.sony.com/bbsc/ssr/product-DPTS1) PDF reader, which only supports WebDAV-compatible cloud syncing. This way, I have Papers' own Dropbox sync for backups and synchronization to my iPhone, and this script for synchronization to my e-reader.

##How to use it
###From Papers to directory
To copy the currently-selected papers from Papers to another directory:

`papers_to_device -t <target_dir> <target_root>`

The `<target_dir>` argument is where you want the PDF files to end up. The `<target_root>` argument is optional. The script stores a record here of what papers were copied where.

If you leave out `<target_root>`, it will search all of `<target_dir>`'s parent directories for the record.


####Example
First run:

`papers_to_device -t /Volumes/DPT-S1/Papers/Computer_Vision /Volumes/DPT-S1`

subsequent runs:

`papers_to_device -t /Volumes/DPT-S1/Papers/Computer_Vision`

###From directory to Papers
Perhaps you've annotated some PDFs and want to put them back into Papers. This is where the record file comes inâ€”the script remembers where the original Papers file came from and will put your annotated copy back:

`papers_to_device -f <target_root>`

####Example
`papers_to_device -f /Volumes/DPT-S1`
